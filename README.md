**It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing 
to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.**
## Motivation behind the Project
**We can create a product for the blind which will guide them travelling on the roads without the support of anyone else. We can do this by first converting the scene into text and then the text to voice. Both are now famous applications of Deep Learning. Refer this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLyF4XQLwr0) where its shown how Nvidia research is trying to create such a product.**
